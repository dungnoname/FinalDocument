                Greetings, Ms. Vy. My name is Nguyen Hoang Gia, and I'd like to share my shopping habits.

I’m not a shopaholic; I buy only what I need and budget carefully. I make a list of necessary food items each month and stick to it. For clothes, I shop at Vincom Plaza due to its variety and attractive promotions. I once bought a winter coat at half price, which I still cherish. For electronics, Thể Giới Di Động is my go-to for its good service and quality products. I recently bought a laptop there with helpful guidance from the staff.

I shop online about once a month, using sites like Shopee and Lazada for their discounts and promotions. I recently bought sneakers on sale and a highly-rated smartphone. I consider price, customer reviews, and ratings when shopping online, and I use credit cards for convenience and rewards. 

Although I had a minor issue with an online purchase, the return process was smooth. I now double-check size charts and return policies. I avoid sales items if they seem outdated or damaged, but occasionally, I find good deals, like a designer handbag I bought on sale.

I rarely haggle and usually seek help from friends if needed. That’s a summary of my shopping habits. Thank you for listening.</p>
