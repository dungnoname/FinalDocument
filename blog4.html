                Greetings, Ms. Vy, my name's Nguyen Hoang Gia. Today, I would like to talk about your favorite means of transportation and travel plans.
                
                First, there are many means of transportation in HCM City such as
                and bus, car and motorcycle. But my favorite's bike because it's convenient. Cause my house kinda near school, so I opt to go to school by bike and It takes me 10 minutes to get there. What I love most about the bike is that it beneficial for health and it suitable with my salary.. 
                However, it has some problems such as I have to careful a lot, cause Vietnam's roads are narrow and there are a lots of potholes.
                
                Second, I want to talk about my travel plan.
                I am going to travel to Da Nang with my family for my next vacation, we'll travel by train and stay there for a week, so we can enjoy the beautiful beaches and explore all the delicious local food.
                We opt for Da Nang because of It's stunning scenery and rich culture.  Da Nang is famous with Ba Na Hills, Ngu Hanh Son mountains, and the Dragon Bridge, which is known for Its spectacular fire-breathing shows.
                
                That's all about my favorite means of transportation and travel plan, thank you for your listening.</p>
