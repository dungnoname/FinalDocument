                Greetings, Ms. Vy, my name's Nguyen Hoang Gia. Today, I would like to share my recent vacation experience on Con Dao island.
                To start with let me confess my love for holiday trips, as they offer a nice break from my monotonous schedule. I take two trips per month to not go insane and last joined was Con Dao island, very famous for its historical reason, specifically Con Dao prison, this is also the only place that turtles come here to nest each year in Vietnam. With my family in tow, a journey which started with a coach went from Sai Gon to Vung Tau, then we went by speedboat finally and we've finally arrived at Con Dao. The weather was absolutely perfect I could feel the warm sun on my skin, and the gentle breeze was comforting, the food was exceptionally delightful, make sure not to miss the coconut ice cream, especially when visiting Con Dao, It's a must-try! It was a happy and enjoyable week at Orson Hotel and Resort. We enjoyed activities such as scuba diving to see the coral reefs, eating local cuisine and checking out the historic Con Dao prison island, seeing turtles getting released into the ocean and enjoying beautiful beaches. All in all, I had a fab time on Con Dao island. Each of those moments with my family surrounded by beautiful nature or on an adventurous canoeing or coral diving trip were so precious to me. Despite I had encountered many difficulties before, with unfavorable weather so the trip being canceled right when we arrived in Vung Tau, luckily, this time everything went perfectly. The memories I made here will always be with me, and I plan to come back to this amazing place someday.
                In conclusion, my recent vacation to Con Dao island was truly unforgettable. The overall experience was impeccable, leaving me with a desire to revisit this terrific destination soon.
