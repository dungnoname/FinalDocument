                Greetings, Ms. Vy. My name is Nguyen Hoang Gia, a 17-year-old student at FPT Polytechnic. I'd like to share my personal dress code.

                I stay updated on fashion trends and prefer the Light Academia Style, valuing comfort with soft, cozy clothes in colors like brown and beige. Today, I wore a Harry Potter tee with jeans for a relaxed look suitable for school.
                
                For different occasions, I dress appropriately: simple t-shirts and long pants for school, casual wear for movies, and dresses or a classy vest for weddings to show respect. I avoid shorts and flip flops at school and never wear backless or strapless tops due to personal discomfort.
                
                I enjoy shopping online for deals on sites like Shopee and TikTok but also like trying on clothes in stores. At school, we wear a uniform polo shirt with the school's emblem on Mondays, which is comfortable and easy to coordinate.
                
                In Vietnam, primary school students can wear shorts, but they are typically prohibited in secondary and high school.
                
                In conclusion, my dress code favors casual and comfortable clothing, while still recognizing the need to dress suitably for various occasions. Thank you for listening.</p>
